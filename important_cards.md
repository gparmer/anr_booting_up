# Cards you need to know about

When playing in [jinteki.net](https://www.jinteki.net/), or with an established play group, there a number of cards that you should know about.
These cards either are either very good, and you might want to consider using them, are integral to most of as faction's plans, or define "inflection points" in games that you should "play around".
This is not meant to be a complete list; instead a list of the common many of the most common cards that can "end a game" if you don't know about them.
Netrunner is a brilliant game due to its hidden information, but if you don't know what to expect, hitting these cards can be demoralizing.

## Corporation Cards

- [Hard Hitting News](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/find/?q=hitting) - This card effectively reads "If you run in a turn, be sure that you have enough credits to clear *four* tags (normally, 8 credits).".
  This card is often used in NBN decks, especially [Controlling the Message](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/11017), but also in many Weyland kill decks.
  If you're running this card, beware that Shapers often run [Misdirection](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/11085) to cheaply clear the tags.
- [Archer](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/20084) - Weyland decks based on slowing your down by killing your programs and other cards, often use this card.  
  If the corporation has scored an agenda that they might be willing to sacrifice, then plan to see this ICE.
  For example, if you see [standoff](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/12077), assume they are running Archer.  
  Similarly, beware of [Tithonium](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/12098).  This is rarely seen outside of Weyland.
- Really good ICE including [Fairchild 3.0](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/11049), [Anansi](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21051), [DNA Tracker](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/11053), [Architect](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/06061), and [Komainu](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/05017).
  All of these ICE can drastically change a game.
  Face check (run into ICE without the appropriate breaker) at your own risk.
  For [Fairchild 3.0], run your first click, so you can use the rest of your clicks to break it.
  Always watch a Corp's credit pool to see if they have enough to rez these ICE.
- [Quantum Predictive Model](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/09007) and [Data Raven](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/20113) are often paired together.
  If you run the a Raven, you'll have a tag, which means scoring a QPM will give your opponent a point!
  If you see a Raven, know that QPM is an option.
- [Neural EMP](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/20106) means that if you run against Jinteki, you might want to be have a card or two in your hand at the end of the turn.
  This card is rare, but something to plan around.
  Also rare, but similarly threatening is [Bio-Ethics Association](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/10050).
- [Obokata Protocol](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/12070) which requires that you forfeit a nearly full hand to steal it.
  Always be sure to have a full hand against Jineteki.
  Similarly, [Ikawah Project](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21010) requires that you have 2 credits and a click to steal.
- [Snare](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/20098), [Psychic Field](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/05010), and [Project Junebug](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/20096) are all threats in Jinteki (and sometimes splashed elsewhere).
  If you run a card, know that it could be one of these.
  Always make sure that you leave a click after the run to clear the tag from a snare (i.e. *never run on last click*), and leave enough clicks to draw up.
  Similarly, HB has some painful ambushes such as [Cerebral Overwriter](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/03009) and [Aggressive Secretary](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/20065), but these are seen more often in other factions.
- When playing [MTI](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21114), they can make your hit a [Cortex Lock](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/08014) with a very low number of credits.
  Also be ware of the ICE listed above if they are on more credits (Anansi is common).
- [NGO Front](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21039) is an *amazing* card, though it may not look like it on the surface.
  The corp can play it down "install, advance, advance", and it looks like a 5/3 agenda.
  This might cause the runner to waste resources trying to go contest the fake agenda.
  This might feel safe if the corp is on a low credit total.
  But the corp can rez the NGO Front at any point, which will give them the 8 credits they need to rez some nasty ice.
  This is a great bluffing + money card, all in one.
  Similarly, [Rashida](http://www.netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21080) is a good card for bluffing an unadvanced agenda, and is a huge accellerant.
  Because this can only be used at the start of the turn, the runner can trash it before it is used.

# Netrunner is Dead; Long Live Netrunnner!
**Starting to play Netrunner in the post-FFG era.**

Android Netrunner (aka Netrunner) is a wonderful card game created by Fantasy Flight Games (FFG) 
It is set in a Cyber-Noir future in which vast Corporations control most of the earth, and beyond.
These include 
- *Weyland*, that constructed a space elevator called the [beanstalk]() and are adept at lunar mining, and don't hesitate to flatten a neighborhood to hurt the opposition; 
- *NBN*, the communications powerhouse that indends to watch everyone, everywhere, then use that omnipontence to extract maximal value, or drive enemies to ruin;
- *Haas Bioroid* (HB), whose artificial intelligence and focus on efficiency produces legions of androids intent on being the labor force of the world; and
- *Jinteki* that competes fiercely with HB with its deep expertise in genetic modifications that instead focus on clone technology to provide cheap labor.

A small group of passionate *runners* (think "hackers") dare to oppose these corporations.
They belong to a number of groups including:
- *Criminals* that are motivated by wealth, and use trickery, subterfuge, and lies to accumulate as much of it as possible; 
- *Shapers* that seek to bend the world around them are motivated by knowledge and cleverness, and use the efficiency of Rube Goldberg setups to brute force into anything; and
- *Anarchs* that feed on rebellion, chaos, and destruction, to watch the world burn, often with reckless disregard of their own safety.

Mechanically, Netrunner has a number of wonderfully implemented characteristics: 

- Card game, but with base capabilities.
- It is an asymmetric game.
- Each player chooses a unique identity that sets the theme and direction of the deck.
- 

Netrunner is nothing if not diverse.
Over the game's life, Netrunner has visited the site of the beanstalk in South America, the thriving cities in India, the metropolis of Africa, the mining colonies on the Moon, and those with tendencies toward rebellion on Mars.
Of the runner identities, they represent the increasingly global future with many ethnicities, equal gender representation, and cyber-diversity (from genetic-mods, cybernetics, and androids, to "natural"s).

Netrunner is quite unique in the card-gaming community.
